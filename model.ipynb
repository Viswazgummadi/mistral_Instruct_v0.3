FOREWORD \\n0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 6 ) ( Third Revision ) was adopted by \\nthe Indian Standards Institution on 16 January 1987, after thedraft \\nfinalized by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous Metals \\nSectional Committee Chad been approved by the Structural and \\nMetals Division Council. \\n0.2 IS : 228 which was issued -as a tentative standard in 1952 and \\nrevised in 1959, covered the chemical analysis of pig iron, cast iron \\nand plain carbon and low alloy steels. For convenience, it was decided \\nto publish a comprehensive series on chemical analysis of steels \\nincluding high alloy steels. Accordingly, revision of IS : 228 was \\ntaken-up again and new series on methods of chemical analysis of \\nsteels including high alloy steels was published in various parts as \\nIS : 228 ( Parts 1 to 13 ) ( see Appendix A ) covering separate method \\nof analysis for each constituent in steels. However, IS : 228-1959* \\nversion has been retained for the analysis of pig iron and cast iron \\ntill a separate standard for analysis of pig iron and cast iron is \\npublished. \\n0.2.1 This revision of IS : 228 (Part 6 )-1974t has been undertaken \\non the basis of experience gained during the implementation of the \\nstandard by the manufacturers and testing laboratories. \\n0.3 In this revision, major modifications are: \\na) scope of the method has been modified by lowering the limit \\nfor determination of chromium from 0’5 to 0’1 percent; \\n-. \\n*Methodr of chemical analysis of pig iron, cast iron and plain carbon and low alloy \\nrteelr ( &sad). \\n*Methods for chemical analyak of steels: Part 6 Determination of chromium by \\npcrsulphate oxidation method ( for chromium > 0’5 percent ) ( sacond rcuirion). \\n3 IS : 228 ( Part 6 ) - 1987 \\nb) only one method has been prescribed for the correction in the \\ntitration of chromium for dilution effect and colour \\ninterference; and \\nc) inclusion of reproducibility of the method at the ,various levels \\nof chromium content, \\n0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance \\nwith this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be \\nrounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS : Z-1960*. \\n1. SCOPE \\n1.1 This standard ( Part 6) covers the persulphate oxidation method \\nfor determination of chromium content of low alloy and high alloy \\nsteels containing more than or equal to 0’1 percent chromium. This \\nmethod is not applicable for steels containing tungsten. \\n2. SAMPLING \\n2.1 The samples shall be drawn and prepared as prescribed in the \\nrelevant Indian Standard. \\n3. QUALITY OF REAGENTS \\n3.1 Unless specified otherwise, analytical grade reagents and distilled \\nwater ( see IS : 1070-1977t ) shall be employed in the test. \\n4. OUTLINE OF THE METHOD \\n4.1 After d;ssolution of the sample in dilute sulphuric acid and pho- \\nsphoric acid mixture and further treated with nitric acid, chromi,nm, \\nmanganese and ( vanadium if present) are oxidized by ammomum \\npersulphate in presence of silver nitrate as catalyst. Permanganic acid \\nis then destroyed by dilute hydrochloric acid. Chromium is reduced by \\nferrous ammonium sulphate and excess of ferrous ammonium sulphate \\nis back titrated with standard potassium permanganate solution. \\n5. REAGENTS \\n5.1 Phosphoric Acid - Sulphuric Acid Mixture -To 600 ml of \\nWater, add continuously 165 ml of concentrated sulphui-ic acid \\nirP,t;tLy,lt;,nd 132 ml of phosphoric acid ( rd = 1’75 ). Mix, cool and \\n1 \\n*Rulea for rounding off numerical values ( rcmkd ). \\ntSpecification for water for general laboratory use (-second revision ). \\n4 IS z 228 ( Part 6 ) - 1987 \\n5.2 Concentrated Nitric Acid - Relative density = 1’42 (conform- \\ning to IS : 264-1976* ). \\n5.3 Silver Nitrate Solution- 0’5 percent (m/v). Dissolve 5 g of \\nsilver nitrate crystals in water and diluteto 1 litre. \\n5.4 Ammonium Persulphate Solution - Dissolve 15 g of \\nammonium persulphate in 100 ml of water. Use a freshiy prepared \\nsolution. \\n5.5 Potassium Permanganate Solution - 1 percent ( m/v ). \\n5.6 Dilwte Hydrochloric Acid - 1 : 3 (ZJ/II). Dilute 250 ml of \\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid (rd = 1’16 j to 1 litre. \\n5.7 Standard Ferrous Ammonium Sulphate Solution - \\nApproximately 0’1 N. Dissolve 40 g of ferrous ammonium sulphate in \\nsulphuric acid ( 5 percent) and dilute to 1 litre. Filter, if necessary, \\nand keep in a stoppered glass bottle. Standardize against standard- \\npotassium permanganate solution ( given under 5.8) every time it is \\nused. \\n5.8 Standard Potassium Permanganate Solution - Approxi- \\nmately 0’1 N. Dissolve 3.2 g of potassium permanganate crystals \\nin 1 000 ml of water, stir and allow to stind in a closed vessel for \\n24 hours. Filter, through a sintered glass crucible and keep in an \\namber-coloured glass bottle. Standardize the solution as follows: \\nDissolve 9’134 g of sodium oxalate crystals, dried for 1 hour \\nat 105°C in 200 ml of dilute sulphuric acid (1 : 50). Heat to 70°C \\nand titrate with potassium permanganate solution until one drop \\nproduces a permanent pink colouration. [ 1 ml of potassium \\npermanganate solution (0’1 N) = 0’006 7 g of sodium oxalate 1. \\n6. PROCEDURE \\n6.1 Take 2 g of sample (for chromium less than 2 percent) \\nand 0’2 to 0’5 g of sample for high alloy steels in a wide mouth conical \\nflask. Add 50 ml of phosphoric acid-sulphuric acid mixture. Heat \\nthe flask to decompose the sample. Oxidize black residue by addition \\nof concentrated nitric acid dropwise and heating the solution \\nsimultaneously till all carbides are decomposed and brown fumes are \\nexpelled. Dilute to 300 ml with hot water. \\n*Specification for nitric acid (second retision ), IS t 228 ( Part 6 ) - 1987 \\n6.2 Add a few pieces of glass beads, heat the solution to boiling \\nand add 20 ml of silver nitrate solution and 20 ml of ammonium \\npersulphate solution adding little at a time and continue boiling till \\nthe permanganate colour develops fully (volume should be maintained \\nat 300 ml by addition of hot water, if necessary and also boiling should \\nbe a period of 8-10 minutes). It should be ensured that sufficient \\npersulphate is added. Wash the sides of the conical flask with water. \\nIf the colour does not develop add a few drops of potassium \\npermanganate solution till the pink colour develops. \\n6.3 Add dilute hydrochloric acid dropwise to the boiling solution till \\npermanganic acid colour is destroyed. Boil for 10 minutes more. Cool \\nand add a known volume of standard ferrous ammonium sulphate \\nsolution until an excess of at least 5 ml is present. Titrate back with \\ndropwise addition of standard potassium permanganate solution to a \\npermanent pink end point which persists for 30-40 seconds. \\n6.4 In presence of vanadium, titrate carefully to a pmk ends point \\nwhich persists for at least. 30 to 40 seconds, to ensure complete \\nre-oxidation of the vanadium. \\n6.5 The titration should be corrected for dilution effect and colour \\ninterference. The correction may be made by the following method: \\n6.5.1 Add same amount of ferrous ammonium sulphate as used for \\nthe sample, to the already titrated solution. Titrate with standard \\npotassium permanganate to pink end point which lasts for 30 to 40 \\nseconds. \\n7. CALCULATION \\n7.1 Calculate the chromium content of the steel as follows: \\nChromium, percent = (AB - C) D x 0’017 33 x 100 \\nE \\nwhere \\nA = volume in ml of standard ferrous ammonium sulphate \\nsolution added, \\nB = volume in ml of standard potassium permanganate \\nsolution equivalent to 1 ml of ferrous ammonium \\nsulphate solution, \\nc = volume in ml of standard potassium permanganate \\nsolution required for titration, corrected for the blank, \\n6 18:2ZS(Part6)-1987 \\nD = normality of standard potassium permanganate \\nsolution, and \\nE = mass in g of the sample taken for the test. \\n7.2 Reproducibility \\na) f0’025 percent at 0’1 to 0’5 percent chromium, \\nb) f0’036 percent at 0’5 to 1 percent chromium, \\nc) fO’l20 percent at 1 to 5 percent chromium, and \\nd) ~fO’20 percent for chromium 5 percent and above. \\nAPPENDIX A \\n( Clause 0.2 ) \\nINDIAN STANDARDS ON METIIODS FOR CHEMICAL \\nANALYSIS OF STEELS \\nIS : 228 Methods for chemical analysis of steels: \\n(Part 1 )-1972 Determination of carbon by volumetric method \\n( for carbon > 0’ 1 percent ) ( second rev&ion ) \\n( Part 2 )A987 D e ermination t of manganese in plain carbon and \\nlow alloy steels by arsenite method ( thid revision > \\n(Part 3 )-1987 Determination of phosphorus by alkalimetric \\nmethod ( third revision ) \\n( Part 4)-1987 Determination of carbon by gravimetric method \\n( for carbon > 0‘1 percent ) ( third revision ) \\n( Part 5 )-1987 Determination of nickel by dimethyl lyoxime \\n( gravimetric ) method ( for nickel > 0’ 1 percent \\nrevision ) 3 (second \\n( Part 6 )-1987 Determination of chromium by persulphate \\noxidation method ( for chromium > 0’1 percent ) (third \\nrevision ) \\n( Part 7 )-1974 Determination of molybdenum by a-benzoinoxime \\nmethod ( for molybdenum > 1 percent ) (second revision) \\n7 IS:228(Part6)-1987 \\n( Part 8 )-1975 Determination of silicon by the gravimetric method \\n( for silicon > 0’1 percent ) ( second revision ) \\n( Part 9)-1975 Determination of sulphur ,in plain carbon steels by \\nevolution method (second revision ) \\n( Part 10 )-1976 Determination of molybdenum by thiocyanate \\n(photometric) method ( for molybdenum up to 1 percent ) \\nin low and high alloy steels ( second revision ) \\n( Part 11 )-1976 Determination of silicon by photometric method in \\ncarbon steels and low alloy steels (for silicon 0’01 to \\n0’05 percent ) ( second revision ) \\n( Part 12 )-1976 Determination of manganese by periodate \\n( photometric ) method in low and high alloy steels ( for \\nmanganese up to 2 percent ) ( second revision ) \\n(Part 13)-1982 Determination of arsenic \\n8 IS : 228 ( Part 6 ) - 1987 \\n( Continuedfrom page 2 ) \\nMnnbcrs \\nSH~I J.

FOREWORD \\n0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 4 ) (Third R cvision ) was adopted I)y \\nthe Indian Standards Institution on 16 January 1987, afirr the draft \\nfinalized by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Pcrrous Metals \\nSectional Committre had been approved by the Structural and Mct;~ls \\nDivision Council. \\n0.2 IS : 228, which was issued as a tentative standard in 1952 and \\nrevised in 1959, covered the chemical analysis of pig iron, cast iron and \\nplain carbon and low alloy steels. For the convenience it was decidctl \\nto publish a comprehensive series on chemical analysis of steels \\nincluding high alloy steels. Accordingly, revision of IS : 228 was \\ntaken-up again and new series on method of chemical analysis of \\nsteels including high alloy steels was published in various parts as \\nIS : 228 ( Parts 1 to 13 ) ( see Appendix A ) covering separate method \\nof analysis for each constituent in steels. However, IS : 228-195!)* \\nversion has been rctainc tl for the analysis of pig iron and cast iron till \\na separate standard for analysis of pig iron and cast iron is phlishctl. \\n0.2.1 This revision of IS : 228 (Part 4)-19747 has been undcrtnkcn \\non the basis of experience gained during the implementation of \\\\he \\nstandard by the manufacturers and testing laboratories. \\n0.3 In this revision, method has been updated. \\n*Methods of chemical analysis of pig iron, cast won and plain carb’on and low \\nalloy 1teela [ rruiud )* \\ntMethod1 for chemical analysis of steels: Part 4 Determination of carbon by \\ngravimetric method ( for carbon > 0.1 percent ) (rend rmi~ion ). \\n3 IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \\n8.4 In rr,porting 111~ reslllt of a test or analysis made in accordance \\nr\\\\.itIl tItis 51 ;~ntlartl, if the final value, ohservcd or calculated, is to be \\nI r)~~trcIt~tI 011; it >11;111 Iw clone in accordance with IS : 2-1960*. \\n1. SCOPE \\n1.1 This standard (Part 4) covers the method for determination of \\ntotal carljon content of plain carbon, low alloy and high alloy steels \\nnfO.1 pcrccnt and above by the grnvimctric method. \\n2. OUTLINE OF THE METHOD \\n2.1 The sample is burnt in a stream of purified oxygen and the \\ncarhnn dioxide formctl is al~wrlwtl, after purihation, in suitable \\nahorhant and tlc~tcrminc~cl. \\n3. REAGENTS \\n3.1 Oxygen (On) - 90’5 percent minimum. \\n3.2 Accarite or Soda Lime -- 0’80 to 2’00 mm. \\n3.3 Magnesium Perchlorate - Mg (CIO( )2, 0.80 to 2’00 mm. \\n3.4 Boat/Crucible - Boat/crucible of precise dimension for \\naccommodating in the r&stance and induction furnace. \\n3.4.1 Preignitc the boats/crucibles in air or oxygen in a furnace for \\nan hour at 1 100°C and stnrc in a desiccator and check for consistancy \\nof the blank values. \\n3.5 Flux,‘Accelerator - Low carbon copper, red lead ( preignited \\nat 550’(Z), tin and iron of low carbon content. \\n4. APPARATUS \\n4.1 The apparatus recommended in IS : 6226 (Part l)-1971t may be \\n11setl \\n4.2 Instead 01‘ the resistance furnace, an induction furnace may also \\nbe used. \\n--- \\n*Rules for rounding ofl’ numerical valuer ( mid). \\ntRecommcndation for apparatus for chemical analysis of metals: Put I \\nDetermination of carbon by direct combustion. \\n4 IS:228(Part4)-1987 \\n5. SAMPLING \\n5.1 The sample shall be drawn as prescribed in the relevant Indian \\nStandards. \\n5.2 The sample is to be cleaned with analar grade ether and acetone, \\ndried in an air oven at 100 f 5°C. \\n6. PROCEDURE \\n6.1 Assemble the apparatus. Switch on the furnace, if it is a resistance \\nfurnace, and allow it to attain a temperature of 1 05O’C (see Note ), all \\nthe while passing oxygen through the apparatus so that it bubbles \\nfreely at the exit end of the train. Disconnect the absorption bulb, \\nkeep in a desiccator till it attains room temperature and take the \\ninitial weight. Repeat the operation till a constant weight is \\nobtained. . \\nNOTB - For high chromium and high nickel rteelr, the temperature of 1 250°C \\nin recommended for complete comburtion. \\n6.2 Weigh to the nearest 0’001 g, 2’0 to 3’0 g of the test sample. \\nTransfer to the preignited combustion boat covered at the bottom \\nwith a thin layer of calcined alumina. Spread the sample evenly over \\nthe top of the alumina and cover it with 2’0 to 3’0 g of the flux. \\nIntroduce the boat slowly In the hot zone of the combustion tube. \\n6.3 In the case of induction heating, weigh to the nearest 0’001 g, 0’9 \\nto 1’1 g of the sample and transfer to a preignited crucible. Add an \\nequal quantity of the flux. Place the crucible in Position on the \\npedestal post of the furnace, raise to the combustion position and \\nlock the system. Pass oxygen through the system and ignite the sample. \\n6.4 Maintain a rapid flow of oxygen ( 800 to 1 000 ml/min) throughout \\nthe combustion, then reduce to 400 to 500 ml per min and maintain \\nit for another 6 co 8 min in order to sweep out the carbon dioxide. \\n6.5 Remove the absorption bulb and weigh it after keeping it in \\ndesiccator till it attains room temperature. The increase in weight of \\nthe bulb represents the carbon dioxide. \\n6.6 Remove the boat or crucible and examine for any incomplete \\ncombustion. If the sample is not thoroughly fused, repeat the \\ndetermination with a fresh sample. \\n6.7 Blank - Charge a prei nited boat or crucible, as the case may be, \\nwith the same amount of B ux used in the determination and follow \\nthe procedure as in 6.2 to 6.5. \\n5 IS:228(Part4)-1981 \\n7. CALCULATION \\n7.1 Calculate the total carbon content of the sample as follows: \\nCarbon, percent A-B = --x 27’29 c \\nwhere \\nA = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \\ncarbon dioxide from the sample, \\nB = increase in mass in g of the absorption bulb due to \\ncarbon dioxide from the blank determination, and \\nC= mass in g of the sample taken. \\n8. ACCURACY \\n8.1 The accuracy of the method is & 0’01 percent for carbon in the \\nrange of 0’1 to 0’75 percent and f 0’02 percent for carbon \\nabove 0’75 percent. \\nAPPENDIX A \\n( Clause 0.2 ) \\nINDIAN STANDARDS ON METHODS FOR CHEMICAL \\nANALYSIS OF STEELS \\nIS : 228 Methods for chemical analysis of steels: \\n( Part 1 )-I972 Determination of carbon by volumetric method \\n( for carbon > 0’1 percent ) ( second revision ) \\n( Part 2)-1972 Determination of manganese in plain carbon and \\nlow alloy steels by arsenite method ( second revision ) \\n( Part 3 )-1972 Determination of phosphorus by alkalimetric method \\n( second rcvisiorr ) \\n( Part 4 )-1987 Determination of total carbon by gravimetric method \\n( for carbon ) 0’1 percent ) ( third revision ) \\n( Part 5 )-I974 Determination of nickel by dimethyl lyoxime \\nravimetric ) method ( for nickel > 0’5 percent \\n?!Xon ) s ( second \\nG IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \\n(Part S)-1974 Determination of chromium hy persi!ipha?e \\noxidation method ( for chromium > 0‘5 percent : I serond \\nrcuision ) \\n( Part 7 )-1974 Determination of molybdenum by a-bcnzoinoxirne \\nmethod ( for molybdenum > 1 pwccnt ) ( ~vtond rFi/iJiott ) \\n( Part 8)-1975 Determination of silicon by the_ ~ravimetric method \\n( for silicon > 0’ 1 percent ) ( second reutszon ) \\n(Part 9)-1975 Determination of sulphur in plain CW~J(JII steels by \\nevolution met hod (second revirion ) \\n( Parr 10 )-1976 Determination of molybdenum by thiocyannte \\n(photometric) method ( for molybdenum up to 1 perwnt ) \\nin low and high alloy steels ( second reviJir,tl ) \\n( Part 11 )-1976 Determination of silicon by photometric method in \\ncarbon steels and low alloy steels ( for silicon 0’01 to 0’05 \\npercent ) ( second relision ) \\n( Part 12 )-I976 Determination Of manganese hy periodate \\n(photometric) method in low and high i\\\\lloy steels ( for \\nmanganese up to 2 percent ) ( second revision ) \\n( Part 13 )-1982 Determination of arsenic \\n7 IS : 228 ( Part 4 ) - 1987 \\nRaprcsraIing \\nSteel Authority of India Ltd (Durgapur Steel \\nPlant ), Durgapur \\nSJIRI P.
